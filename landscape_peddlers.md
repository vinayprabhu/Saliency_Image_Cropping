As it turns out, it is possible to train neural networks to predict such salient regions. A prediction of such a network is called a saliency map. It basically is a grayscale image of the same size as the picture. Each pixel intensity encodes the degree of saliency. These saliency maps allow us to find the best image region for a given aspect ratio."                                                  |

The products we build are a result of that exploration. And Deep Crop is the latest product from Polarr.<br>Deep Crop is a simple app enabled by complex and powerful A.I. With Deep Crop anyone can crop their photos like a professional photographer". "Polarr says it trained the app using 200 million cropping data points gleaned from the work of real photographers". |
