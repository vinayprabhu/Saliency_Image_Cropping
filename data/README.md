Our WACV-2022 paper📜 spans two experiments 🥼:

- Male-gaze-like (MGL) experiments with 336 images drawn from Flickr 🖼️
- Race-Gender (RG) experiments using images from the Chicago Faces dataset (CFD)

As such, we have two files associated each of the two experiments each:

1. ```df_cfd_3k.csv```: A 3000 x 37 dataframe spanning the 3000 images created from CFD
2. ```col_descriptions_cfd_3k.csv```: A 37 x 2 dataframe describing the 37 columns of ```df_cfd_3k.csv```
3. ```df_mgl_336.csv```: A 336 x 29 dataframe spanning the 336 images created from the MGL dataset
4. ```col_descriptions_mgl_336.csv```:  A 29 x 2 dataframe describing the 29 columns of ```df_mgl_336.csv```
